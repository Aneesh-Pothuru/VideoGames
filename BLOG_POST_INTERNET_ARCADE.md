# The Internet Arcade

## Online Expereince

When playing the tetris game online, I was surprised how similar it was. The emulator was true to the original game, with the classic blocks and sound effects. The online emulator was well designed, with intuitive controls and a smooth playing experience.

## Compare to Arcade

As a kid, I would spend a lot of time playing Tetris on my Game Boy, but playing the arcade edition was a whole different experience. The game was bigger, the graphics were brighter, and the sound was more enthralling. It was an encounter that I will never forget.

When I came across an online version of the arcade game, I was thrilled to relive some of those memories. Nonetheless, playing the online version was pleasurable, yet it simply couldn't match up to the real thing. The online emulator was restrained by the size of my computer screen and the sound quality of my speakers. The keys on my keyboard didn't have the same tactile feeling as the arcade buttons.

Yet, the actual enchantment of the arcade version of Tetris was the social element. The arcade was always packed with people of all ages, gathered around the machines, competing against each other and cheering each other on. The energy in the room was obvious and it was a truly magical experience.
