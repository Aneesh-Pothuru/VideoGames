# Quest - Prototyping

## Description

Quest is intended to be a party game for 2 or more players that offers a point based currency system where the player's goal is to reach 200 points first. It might seem smart at first to just roll to get 200 points, but using the shop can give you an advantage in the future of the game. The rules for the game are listed in the image below:

## Session Report

My friend Sai and I played a board game called Quest. The objective of the game was to reach 200 points first. We started with 10 points each and took turns rolling the die and moving along the board.

Every time we landed on a tile, we had to pick a card of the same color and compete in an event to win or lose points. The events ranged from trivia questions to mini-games. Sai got lucky and won a few events, taking an early lead with a score of 95-60.

Feeling the pressure, I decided to visit the shop and buy some items to increase my chances of winning in the long run. I bought a card that allowed me to move forward up to three tiles, which I later used to get a card that added 50 points to my score.

After a few more turns, Sai was still in the lead, but I was slowly catching up. However, in the end, Sai managed to reach the target of 200 points first and won the game with a score of 200-135.

## Core Mechanics

### Dice

The core mechanic of rolling a die. Players take turns rolling the die to move through the board, collecting points, and encountering different tasks along the way. Rolling the die is the fundamental action of the game, determining how far a player can move on their turn. The die used in the game has a varying number of faces, depending on the specific version being played.

The game board is a square with various tiles, including a start tile and an end tile. Players can use their points to activate abilities that allow them to move forward or backward a square. Landing on certain tiles triggers different outcomes for players. Players continue taking turns rolling the die, moving around the board and completing tasks until one of them reaches 200 points to win the game.

Dice rolling is the primary mechanic of Quest, adding excitement and unpredictability to the gameplay. Players must use strategy when rolling the die and managing their points to outscore their opponent. Quest can be modified by using different dice with various numbers of faces to increase the game's variety and difficulty.

### Constant Income

In board games, it's important to keep the gameplay moving forward, so players don't lose interest or become stuck in the same place for too long. One way to achieve this is by adding a constant income of points as a mechanic.

In Quest, players earn points by completing tasks on the board or landing on specific tiles. However, the constant income of points adds a sense of progress to the game, even when players may not be able to complete tasks or land on high-scoring tiles.

At the start of the game, players begin with 10 points, and on each turn, they earn an additional 5 points. This may seem like a small amount, but it adds up quickly and helps keep the game moving forward. Even if a player has a bad roll or cannot complete a task, they still earn points and can work towards the goal of reaching 200 points to win the game.

By incorporating a constant income of points, Quest ensures that players always have a sense of progress, even if their gameplay strategy doesn't go according to plan. It also adds a layer of strategy, as players must balance earning points on their turn with completing tasks and landing on high-scoring tiles.

### Shop

A shop was added to the game to increase the level of strategy that players could employ. The shop provided a way for players to spend their earned points on items that would benefit them in the long run. By spending points on items like ability cards, players could gain the ability to move further or faster on the board, which in turn would help them to collect more points and complete tasks more quickly.

For example, in the game of Quest, Aneesh decided to buy an ability card that let him move forward up to 3 tiles. This allowed him to move more quickly around the board and collect more points in a shorter amount of time. He then used his accumulated points to purchase a card that would add 50 points to his score. This strategy allowed Aneesh to make a big leap forward in the game and catch up to Sai, who had previously been leading.

By adding a shop mechanic, the game of Quest became more dynamic and allowed players to make strategic decisions about how they wanted to spend their points. This added an extra layer of complexity to the game and made it more engaging for players who were looking for a deeper gaming experience.
