# Blog Post 9: Course Reflection 

## Biggest Takeaway

Growing up, I played a lot of games. I played Pokemon, Call of Duty, Mario Kart, and Clash of Clans. As you can see I played games from basically every device, from handheld to PC.

After taking this class I realized the amount of work these developers and artists put into the development of these games.

The biggest thing that took away from this class is the MDA analysis. It showed me a way to understand the game and its effectiveness to appeal to the consumer.

## Most Interesting

The most interesting part about this class was learning all the game development tools. Game engines like Unity, Unreal, etc. have really shown me the depth of detail game developers can get into.

## Course Overview

In this class, I learned a lot about how games were created and why they are so successful. It gave me a new definition to the word art. 

Everytime I play a game, I try to understand the mechanics that they use that are similar to other games I play.

## Final Presentation

For the final we decided to do a presentation to teach the class about ways to make money from the games they create in an ethical way.

We wrote about the gaming industry and where it is leading to. We wanted to showcase the bad actors in the space so people don't get trapped in this sitation and they are able to play the games without being exploited for money.
