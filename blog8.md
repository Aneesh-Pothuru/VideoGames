# Blog Post 8: Final Project 

# Introduction
For our final, we decided to do a presentation. In this presentation we decided to look at how money affects the gaming industry. It's hard to ignore the meteoric rise of Gacha games and games with collectibles in recent years. With their enticing gameplay mechanics and the thrill of acquiring rare items, these games have managed to capture the hearts (and wallets) of millions of players worldwide. One such example is the story of a man who spent over $70,000 on a Gacha game, a testament to their addictive nature. In this blog post, we will delve into the history, mechanics, and psychology behind these games, as well as explore the current juggernaut of the genre, Genshin Impact.

# History of Gaming Revenue
The gaming industry has come a long way since the early days of arcade machines and home consoles. As technology advanced, so did the methods by which game developers generated revenue. From the classic pay-to-play model to subscription-based services and in-game purchases, the monetization of video games has evolved drastically over time. Gacha games and games with collectibles are the latest revenue-generating phenomenon in the industry, attracting players with their enticing mechanics and a plethora of virtual items to acquire.

## Genshin Impact: The Crown Jewel of Gacha Games

Genshin Impact, released in September 2020, has quickly risen to become the largest Gacha game on the market. Developed by the Chinese company miHoYo, Genshin Impact has managed to enthrall millions of players with its open-world exploration, stunning graphics, and Gacha mechanics. Players can use in-game currency, which can be earned or purchased, to obtain new characters and items, driving the game's revenue to new heights.

## Signups & Battle Passes

Many Gacha games and games with collectibles, including Genshin Impact, employ the use of signups and battle passes as part of their monetization strategy. These features incentivize players to regularly engage with the game by offering rewards for completing specific objectives or playing for a certain amount of time. By encouraging consistent play, these games build a dedicated player base that is more likely to make in-game purchases.

## Conclusion - Loss Aversion & Anchoring Effect

The psychological aspects of Gacha games cannot be ignored. Loss aversion, the concept that humans are more affected by the possibility of losing something than gaining it, plays a significant role in driving in-game purchases. By creating a sense of scarcity or limited availability, Gacha games tap into the fear of missing out. Additionally, the anchoring effect, where players base their decisions on initial information, further fuels the desire to make in-game purchases.
