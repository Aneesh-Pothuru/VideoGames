The first game I played was Soul Shape. The part I liked about this game is that it felt familiar, it looked almost like Tetris but with an interesting twist. The aesthetics of this game are similar to Tetris, with bright, colorful blocks and a minimalist interface. However, the addition of a physics engine adds a level of realism to the game, making it more engaging and immersive. The aesthetic was the same but the mechanics were different. There was a physics engine in the game to change the way blocks moved. This engine means that players must strategically place blocks to complete the level while also dealing with the physics engine that affects how the blocks move and interact with each other. The dynamics of this game are heavily influenced by the physics engine. Players need to be mindful of the weight and shape of each block to use it to complete the levels.

## Slime Climb

Slime Climb is a game that requires a player to jump up to higher platforms. The objective is to go as high as possible by jumping up to platforms that keep moving. The screen keeps moving up and if the character is not able to make it to the next platform in time, they lose. The primary mechanics of the game involve jumping to reach higher platforms while avoiding obstacles. The player has control over the timing and direction of their jumps. The mechanics combine to create a dynamic gameplay experience. The player must continually assess the distance and timing of their jumps to successfully progress upwards. The aesthetic of the game is precision and reflexes.

Frosty Hike is a game that looks very similar to mario. The game requires the character to move forward and jump around enemy characters that walk around a certain area. The game has platforms and trenches to add a depth of challenge. The primary mechanics of the game involve moving forward, jumping, and avoiding enemy characters. The platforms and trenches provide an added layer of complexity to the gameplay. The dynamic of the game requires the player to constantly assess the environment, timing their movements and jumps to avoid obstacles. The game's aesthetics is shown through the similarities of Mario with the character design being cartoonish and appealing, with quirky enemy characters.

## Comparision

#### Frosty Hike

Mechanics: Moving forward, jumping, avoiding enemy characters, platforms, and trenches.
Dynamics: Constantly assessing the environment, timing movements and jumps, and adapting to dynamic challenges with enemy characters.
Aesthetics: Cartoonish character design, appealing and quirky enemy characters.

#### Slime Climb

Mechanics: Jumping to reach higher platforms, avoiding obstacles, and controlling the timing and direction of jumps.
Dynamics: Continually assessing the distance and timing of jumps, adapting to dynamic challenges with moving platforms.
Aesthetics: Focused on precision and reflexes.

#### Soul Shape

Mechanics: Placing blocks strategically to complete levels, with a physics engine that affects how blocks move and interact.
Dynamics: Being mindful of the weight and shape of each block, and adapting to dynamic challenges with the physics engine.
Aesthetics: Bright, colorful blocks, and a minimalist interface with the addition of a physics engine that makes it more engaging and immersive.

### Similarities
All three games require precise movements and timing. They also have dynamic challenges that require the player to continually adapt to the environment.

### Differences
Frosty Hike and Slime Climb involve a lot of jumping and movement, while Soul Shape involves more strategic thinking and puzzle-solving. Additionally, the aesthetics of each game are unique, with Frosty Hike being more cartoonish, Slime Climb being focused on precision, and Soul Shape being more colorful and immersive with its physics engine.

## Spectator Analysis

#### Frosty Hike

My partner used the platforms and trenches to their advantage, strategically timing their jumps to avoid obstacles, while others may try to speed through the level as quickly as possible.
Players who can anticipate the environment and make quick decisions based on what they see are often the most successful in Frosty Hike.

#### Slime Climb

My partner chose to stay in one spot and time their jumps to reach the next platform, while others may jump from platform to platform more quickly.
Players who can quickly adjust to the speed and movement of the platforms are often the most successful in Slime Climb.

#### Soul Shape

My partner took different approaches to placing blocks, with some players focusing on completing the level as quickly as possible, while others may take a more methodical approach.
Some players may try to use the physics engine to their advantage, while others may find it more challenging and avoid it.
