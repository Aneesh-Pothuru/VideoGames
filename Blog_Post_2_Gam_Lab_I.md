# The Game Lab

## Game 1: Over/Under 

In Over/Under, two teams take turns choosing a card and asking a question. The rest of the players then have to come to a conclusive answer. The questions are numerical, and the player who picked the card must guess whether the answer is over or under the number they chose. If their guess is correct, they get to keep the card and the turn continues.

Our group was composed of four players, and we divided into two teams of two. We started the game and quickly got into the swing of things. The questions were challenging and kept us on our toes, but we managed to come up with answers by using our knowledge and critical thinking skills.


## Game 2: Fluxx 

Fluxx is a game that requires 2 or more players and is perfect for any type of gathering. The game is easy to learn, but offers endless possibilities and strategies, making each game unique and different.

In Fluxx, players start with basic rules, but the game changes constantly as players draw and play cards. There are four types of cards: Action, Keeper, Goal, and Rule. Each turn, a player draws a card and plays a card, changing the rules and goals of the game. The ultimate goal is to match the Keeper cards with the current Goal card in order to win.

Our group was composed of five players, and we started the game with basic rules. It didn't take long for the game to change as we began to draw and play cards. The Action cards allowed us to complete various actions, such as drawing extra cards or swapping keepers with other players. The Rule cards changed the rules of the game, making it more challenging and exciting. The Keeper cards were used to set up for victory, and the Goal cards defined what was needed to win the game.
